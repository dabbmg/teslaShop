/// This is the command for running an environment
nightwatch --env default --tag desktop --config ./nightwatch.conf.js


/////Why? Break it down:

///the --env runs the environment inside of ngihtwatch.conf.js, in the conf file in this folder
 you have an environment named "mobile" that runs chrome using the "iPhone X"
 //"default" runs the default test environment which is just regular chrome

///the --tag is the tag you gave the specific test in the test file
    //the teslaShop.js is tagged desktop

///the --config chooses the config file location
